### **GitHub Notes (Activity 2): Load Balancing Algorithms**  

---

#### **Introduction to Load Balancing Algorithms**  
A **load balancing algorithm** is a method used to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers. The primary goal of using these algorithms is to ensure that no single server is overloaded, thereby maintaining **high availability**, **reliability**, and **optimal performance**.  

By distributing traffic efficiently, these algorithms prevent any server from becoming a bottleneck, optimizing response times, and enhancing the **user experience**.  

---

### **Why Use Load Balancing Algorithms?**  
1. **Resource Optimization:** Ensures efficient use of all available servers.  
2. **High Availability:** Maintains service uptime even if one server fails.  
3. **Improved Performance:** Reduces latency by avoiding overloaded servers.  
4. **Scalability:** Adapts to changes in traffic patterns and server capacity.  

---

### **Common Load Balancing Algorithms**  

#### **1. Round Robin:**  
Distributes incoming requests in a **cyclic order**.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Simple and easy to implement.  
  - Works well when all servers have **similar capacities**.  
- **Cons:**  
  - No consideration of **current server load**.  
  - Not suitable for **stateful applications** as the same client might be directed to different servers.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Works best in **homogeneous environments** where all servers have **equal capacity**.  

---

#### **2. Least Connections:**  
Assigns requests to the server with the **fewest active connections**.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Efficient in **dynamic environments** with varying workloads.  
  - Adapts to **server load changes**.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Requires **real-time monitoring** of active connections.  
  - Higher **implementation complexity**.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Suitable for applications with **variable traffic patterns**.  

---

#### **3. Weighted Round Robin:**  
Enhances Round Robin by assigning **weights** based on server capacity.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Servers with higher capacities handle more requests.  
  - Flexible and **scalable**.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Determining **appropriate weights** can be challenging.  
  - Does not account for **real-time load**.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Ideal for **heterogeneous environments** where servers have **different processing capacities**.  

---

#### **4. Weighted Least Connections:**  
Combines the **Least Connections** and **Weighted Round Robin** principles.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Balances traffic considering **server capacity and current load**.  
- **Cons:**  
  - More **complex** to implement.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Best for environments with **servers of varying capacities** and **dynamic loads**.  

---

#### **5. IP Hash:**  
Routes requests based on the **client's IP address** to ensure **session persistence**.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Ensures that **requests from the same client** are always directed to the **same server**.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Can lead to **uneven distribution** if client IPs are not uniformly distributed.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Suitable for **stateful applications** requiring **consistent server assignment**.  

---

#### **6. Least Response Time:**  
Directs traffic to the server with the **lowest response time**.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Provides **optimal performance** by selecting the fastest server.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Requires **continuous monitoring**.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Ideal for **real-time applications** like **streaming and gaming**.  

---

#### **7. Random:**  
Selects a server **randomly** to handle each request.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Extremely **simple** and **low overhead**.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Can lead to **uneven load distribution**.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Suitable for **homogeneous environments** where all servers are **identical**.  

---

#### **8. Least Bandwidth:**  
Assigns the incoming request to the server that is currently using the **least bandwidth**.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Optimizes for **network-heavy applications**.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Monitoring **bandwidth usage** increases overhead.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Ideal for applications with **high data transfer rates** like **video streaming**.  

---

#### **9. Custom Load:**  
Allows defining **custom metrics** and rules to determine traffic distribution.  
- **Pros:**  
  - Highly **flexible and adaptive**.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Complex to **configure and maintain**.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Best for applications with **specialized requirements**.  

---

### **Fun Analogy:**  
Imagine a **food court** with several food counters. Each counter serves a different type of food, and thereâ€™s a **queue manager (load balancer)** at the entrance.  
- **Round Robin:** Directs people to each counter in a rotating fashion.  
- **Least Connections:** Directs people to the counter with the **shortest line**.  
- **IP Hash:** Always sends the same person to their **favorite counter**.  
- **Weighted Round Robin:** Sends more people to the **larger counters** with more staff.  
- **Custom Load:** Directs based on food preference, counter speed, and number of available dishes.  

**Mnemonic to Remember:**  
**"Really Lazy Writers Love Iced Lattes, Rarely Buying Coffee."**  
- **R:** Round Robin  
- **L:** Least Connections  
- **W:** Weighted Round Robin  
- **L:** Weighted Least Connections  
- **I:** IP Hash  
- **L:** Least Response Time  
- **R:** Random  
- **B:** Least Bandwidth  
- **C:** Custom Load

### **Interview Questions:**  

1. **Q:** What is the primary purpose of load balancing algorithms?  
   **A:** To evenly distribute incoming traffic among multiple servers, ensuring high availability, reliability, and performance.  

2. **Q:** What is the difference between **Round Robin** and **Least Connections**?  
   **A:**  
   - **Round Robin:** Distributes traffic in a cyclic order without considering server load.  
   - **Least Connections:** Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections, dynamically adapting to load changes.  

3. **Q:** Why would you use **Weighted Round Robin** instead of the basic **Round Robin**?  
   **A:** Weighted Round Robin considers server capacity, assigning more traffic to powerful servers, while basic Round Robin treats all servers equally.  

4. **Q:** Which algorithm would you use for **real-time streaming applications**?  
   **A:** **Least Response Time**, as it directs traffic to the server with the **fastest response**, minimizing latency.  

---

#### **Additional Teaching:**  
In real-world scenarios, the choice of load balancing algorithm depends on:  
- **Application Type:** Stateless vs. Stateful  
- **Traffic Characteristics:** Static vs. Dynamic  
- **Server Capacity:** Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous  
- **Performance Requirements:** Response time, session persistence
